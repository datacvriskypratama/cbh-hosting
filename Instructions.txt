## What you need:

1. An apache or other webserver (recommend WAMP server for beginners) to run the php.
2. Autohotkey program to run the "script.ahk" 

I could have compiled the script into an executable file, but virus scanners flag
autohotkey executables as virusses because it is pretty easy to make a malicious 
script with autohotkey. So I just added the decompiled ahk script.

## How to set up:

1. unzip this in your webserver root directory.
2. install or place your minecraft server files in server\ directory.
3. edit serverstartscript.bat and fix the START line to match your server jar and parameters.
4. edit inc/include.php file for your server info. (name, admin login, etc.)
5. Make sure autohotkey script (server\script.ahk) and the webserver are running.

## optional:

- open up the other php files and have a read through, I've added tags what stuff does so it should be easy to figure it all out and change if you want to.
